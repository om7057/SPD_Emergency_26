# Child Safety News API

An API service that fetches and categorizes news articles related to child safety topics.

## Overview

This FastAPI-based service aggregates news articles from various sources using the NewsAPI and automatically categorizes them into relevant child safety topics such as Child Abuse, Sexual Exploitation, Cyberbullying, and more.

## Features

- Fetches recent news articles related to child safety from NewsAPI
- Automatically categorizes articles based on keyword analysis
- Provides a clean REST API endpoint to access categorized news data
- CORS-enabled for frontend integration

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn (ASGI server)
- httpx (Async HTTP client)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/child-safety-news-api.git
   cd child-safety-news-api
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your NewsAPI key:
   - Get an API key from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)

### Interactive API Documentation

FastAPI provides automatic interactive API documentation:

```
child-safety-news-api/
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py              # FastAPI application and routes
│   ├── news_fetcher.py      # Handles fetching news from external API

├── requirements.txt         # Project dependencies
└── README.md                # This file
```

## Categories

The system categorizes articles into the following topics:

- Child Abuse
- Sexual Exploitation
- Online Exploitation
- Cyberbullying
- Child Labour
- Child Marriage
- Mental Health
- Education
- Safety / Protection
- Trafficking
- Uncategorized (default)

## Development

### Adding New Categories

To add new categories, update the `CATEGORY_KEYWORDS` dictionary in `app/news_categorizer.py`:

```python
CATEGORY_KEYWORDS = {
    # Existing categories...
    "New Category": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"],
}
```

### Modifying Search Terms

To change which articles are fetched, modify the `QUERY_TERMS` list in `app/news_fetcher.py`.

## Production Deployment Notes

- Replace `allow_origins=["*"]` with specific allowed origins
- Store the API key as an environment variable rather than hardcoding it
- Consider implementing rate limiting for the API endpoint
- Add proper error handling for the news API requests
